Intelligent Transport Systems: Ramp Metering and Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram 
This project explores Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), focusing on Ramp Metering for freeway traffic management and Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) Analysis for urban traffic optimization.

Key topics covered:

- Ramp Metering Simulation: Implementation of different scenarios on the Naples ring road using SUMO and MATLAB, evaluating traffic flow and congestion control strategies.
- Traffic Flow Analysis: Studying detectors, occupancy, flow, and speed variations to optimize vehicle merging from ramps to the main lane.
- Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD): Monitoring urban traffic in Nola's historic center, applying gating strategies to keep traffic within optimal operational conditions.
- Data Processing & Visualization: Using MATLAB scripts to analyze detector outputs, generate mesh plots, shock-wave diagrams, and congestion trends.
The project demonstrates how data-driven control mechanisms in ITS can enhance traffic efficiency and reduce congestion in both freeway and urban networks.
